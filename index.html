<h1 id="1">If you need professional ear wax removal?</h1>
<p>Your audiologist can assess your <strong>needs and symptoms for earwax removal</strong> and perform an initial examination of your ears.</p>
<p>If you appear to be a candidate for professional ear wax removal, he or she can help you or refer you to an audiologist who can do this. This person may prescribe drops to soften the wax before attempting to remove it. These are placed in the ear and drained after a few minutes.</p>
<p>One thing you should definitely not try is to remove an earwax blockage manually yourself.</p>
<p>Before you or an audiologist&nbsp;attempt any kind of cerumen removal, you should check one crucial thing. "First of all, we need to be absolutely sure that you have an intact eardrum and that there are no other underlying problems in your ear canal or inner ear. In addition, there should be no known history of ear injury. An audiologist&nbsp;will also want to know if you have ever tried to remove earwax yourself.</p>
<p><a title="Microsuction Clinics in Hinckley" href="http://earwaxremoval.info-4all.com/ear-wax-removal-consultations-in-hinckley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="max-width: 60%; margin: 6px;" src="https://stackward.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/woman-audiologist-performing-exam-on-patient.jpg" alt="ear+wax+removal" align="left" /></a></p>
<p>The audiologist will also want to know if you have ever tried to remove ear wax yourself.</p>
<p>Some people try to remove earwax with cotton swabs, hairpins or other fine objects, but this is one of the most commonly cited causes of earwax build-up.</p>
<p>This is because the objects used may remove small amounts of earwax, but the plucking can push the rest of the wax deeper into the ear canal or even perforate the ear drum.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a very nice review on one of our websites:&nbsp;<br />"I am grateful with Mr. Mason Levy&rsquo;s ear wax removal work. My ear was swollen and congested, and the medicated ear drops my doctor prescribed were not working at all. After Mr Levy's earwax removal, the ear healed itself within a few days. Great, attentive and very thorough ear service. Good and professional advice. I would definitely recommend him to others."</p>
<h2 id="2">Ear waxing is really very important, here's why</h2>
<p>Ear wax plays a very important role in protecting the functions of your ear canal. It is a naturally occurring waxy substance that can be thick or thin depending on where it is deposited and for how long. Inside the ear canal, it is produced to protect the delicate, thin skin that lines the ear canal and ear canals and prevents the entry of bacteria and debris that can cause infections.</p>
<p>Even if you try to remove earwax from the pinna regularly, it can build up in the ear canal and cause a natural blockage. Earwax can also accumulate in the ear if you use hearing aids or pressurised headphones, such as those supplied with many mobile phones.</p>
<p>A little earwax is good for your ears, so it's often the best policy not to try to remove it yourself. It's a natural cleanser as it moves from inside the ear canal to the outside, taking dead skin cells, hair and dirt with it.</p>
<p>Tests have shown that it has antibacterial and antifungal properties. If your ears don't have enough wax, you're likely to feel itchy and uncomfortable. And if you don't have the right kind, you may be more prone to ear infections.</p>
<p>If the earwax blockage is very large, it may need to be removed at your hearing care professional's office. Today, microaspiration is most commonly used by hearing care professionals. A curette tool can be used in conjunction with microaspiration.</p>
<h3 id="3">What happens during microsuction?</h3>
<p>What happens during microsuction?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the size and shape of your ear canal, as well as the amount and type of earwax, are genetically determined and cannot be easily changed with medication. To help loosen the wax, we recommend that you apply a squirt of earol (a sterile, sealed olive oil spray) to each ear a few days before your ear wax removal and visit one of our <strong>experts in microscopic ear wax removal</strong> at our new practice in Hinckley. You can book an appointment at our ear wax removal clinic in Hinckley by visiting our website&nbsp;<a title="https://earwaxremoval.webstances.com/" href="https://earwaxremoval.webstances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://earwaxremoval.webstances.com/</a></p>

Jason's team are experts in unblocking a blocked ear and providing primary ear care. They use the latest micro suction equipment which is fast, efficient and painless.</p>
<h2 id="4">Ear wax removal with microsuction</h2>
<p>Our fully qualified and trained audiologists use a procedure known as otoscopy to check for signs of ear wax problems. Otoscopy also allows them to check the general health of your ears to ensure absolute safety before proceeding with microsuction. If our audiologists feel that it is not safe to proceed with microsuction, we will discuss other options for treating an earwax problem. We will start with a detailed history, where we will ask you some relevant questions about your hearing. This is followed by a pre-otoscopic examination, which is important to determine the condition of the ear canal and the extent of the earwax problem. If all is well, we will begin the gentle removal of the earwax using microsuction.</p>

<h3 id="7">What is earwax?</h3>
<p>The ear canal forms ear wax from the inner lining of the ear canal. Ears naturally form wax to lubricate and protect the ear canal. The ear canal is the tube that connects the middle ear to the outer ear. The wax forms a protective barrier against bacteria, infection and damage from water or trauma. Occasionally, the ear can produce an excessive amount of wax. If this wax then causes problems, it may be necessary to have the excess wax removed by an audiologist.</p>
<p>With our <strong>Microsound Removal Service</strong> you can ensure that you get your earwax removed safely, quickly and by someone you trust. This makes the procedure much quicker, safer and less irritating for the patient.</p>
<h3 id="9">How you can benefit from ear wax removal in Hinckley</h3>
<p>Ear-Wax is a natural raw material produced by the body and serves two important functions. The first is to maintain the "PH level" in the ear to prevent microbial infection, and the second is to provide lubrication to prevent excessive moisture build-up. Audiologists often recommend microaspiration to remove excessive amounts of earwax.</p>
